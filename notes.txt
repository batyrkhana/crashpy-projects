Variable Are Labels
    Variable are better thought of as labels that can be assigned to values

2.1. Simple Message: Assign a mesage to a variable and then print that message
2.2. Simple Messages: assign a message to a variable and then print that message then change the value of the variable to a new message and print the new message

Strings

"This is a string"
'This is also a string'

Changing Case in a String with Methods
    name = "ada lovelace"
    print(name.title())
    the output will be the same string but fully capitalized
Methods:
    name.upper()
    name.lower()
    name.title()

Using Variables in Strings
    can be done with the help of    f strings
Adding Whitespace to Strings with Tabs or Newlines
    whitespace is any nonprinting characters usch as spaces, tabs, and end-of line symbols. 
    Whitespace can be used to organize my output so its easier for users to read
    To add a whitespace (indent) (you need to add a \t ):
        print("\tSomething")
    To add a newline(you need to add a \n ):
        print()
Stripping a whitespace
    .rstrip() method to get rid of a whitespace from the right
    .lstrip() method to get rid of a whitespace from the left
    .strip() method to get rid of a whitespace from both right and left
Removing a prefix/suffix example:
    .removeprefix('https://') method
    .removesuffix() method
Numbers
    Integers:
        Add:        2+3
        Subtract:   3-2
        Multiply:   2*3
        Divide:     3/2
        Exponents:  3 ** 2
Floats:
    Any number with a decimal point
        0.1 + 0.1
Integers and flaots:
    Dividing any two numbers will always result in a Floats
Underscores in Numbers:
    When writing long numbers, you can group digits using underscores to maek large numbers more readable
        universe_age = 14_000_000_000
    When printed, python only displays the digits with no underscores
Multiple Assignment:
    You can assign values to more than one variabke using a single line of code
    x, y, z = 0, 0, 0
        this means that the variables x, y, z are initialized as 0
Constants:
    A variable whose value stays the same throughotu teh life of a program
    ALL CAPITAL LETTERS INDICATE A VARIABLE SHOULD BE TREATED AS A CONSTANT AND NEVER CHANGED
    MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000
