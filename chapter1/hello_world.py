message = "Hello Python World"
print(message)

message = "Hello Python Crash Course world!"
print(message)
# you can constantly update the value for the variable message and python will keep track of the update
"""
Rules for Variable:
- variable names can contain only leetters, numbers, and underscores. they can start with a letter or an underscore but not with a number
    you can call a variable message_1 but not 1_message
- spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used to separate words in variable names. 
    greeting_message works but greeting message will cause errors
- DO NOT USE PRINT AS A VARIABLE NAME
- Be careful with lowercase l and uppercase O as it can represent 1 and 0
